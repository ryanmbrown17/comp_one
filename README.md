Applied Math I:
Infinite Series, Complex Algebra, Ordinary Differential Equations, Special Functions, Fourier Series, Vector Spaces, Operators and Matrices.

Computting II: 
Computing II focuses on the implementation and applications of data structures, including arrays, 
linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, binary trees, binary search trees, heaps, graphs, and hash tables. 
Recursive approaches are used. Performance analysis is discussed. Attention is paid to programming style, documentation, and testing.

Machine Learning:
This introductory course gives an overview of machine learning techniques used in data mining and pattern recognition applications. Topics include: foundations of 
machine learning, including statistical and structural methods; feature discovery and selection; parametric and non-parametric classification; supervised and unsupervised learning; use of contextual evidence; clustering, recognition with strings; small sample-size problems and applications to large datasets.

Optimization:
Optimization without calculus; geometric programming; convex sets and convex functions; review of linear algebra; linear programming 
and the simplex method; convex programming; iterative barrier-function methods; iterative penalty-function methods; iterative least-squares algorithms;
iterative methods with positivity constraints; calculus of variations; applications to signal processing, medical imaging, game theory.
