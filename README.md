# comp_two
Computting Two Hws and Projects,  all in C.

Sample HWs:
Daily 5-Using data abstraction, write a program that sets, unsets, and displays bitflags
Daily 7-  Reverse a linked list
Daily 8- Implement a stack using data abstraction, then read from input file and determine if the parenthesis and brackets are correctly placed (every left has a right, and no closing bracket before parentesis and vice versa)
Daily 9 - Implement a Priority Queue with data abstraction
Program 1- Daily5+, implement bit flags by telling the init number of bits wanted and implement it allocating the right size
Program 2- Using a queue to simulate a ferry and tell the number of crosses needed to move all the cars for a given situation.
Program 3-Program1+ Input numbers and have the numerous flags set based on input

Evil Hangman (lab)-
writing my own type string, tree via data abstraction as well as using generic_vector given in class implement a running program of a cheating program which plays hangman with the user.
